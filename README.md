# 🏦 Banking Analytics & Fraud Detection – SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing banking transaction data using SQL to solve real-world business and fraud detection problems.

The dataset simulates a banking environment including:

* Customers
* Accounts (Savings / Current)
* Transactions
* Branches
* Fraud Flags

---

##  Business Objectives

The project answers 15 analytical business questions, including:

1. Total transaction amount per account
2. Average transaction amount per customer
3. Transaction count per merchant category
4. High-value transactions (> 100,000)
5. Total transactions and amount per branch
6. Active vs inactive accounts
7. Top 5 customers by transaction volume
8. Average debit vs credit transaction comparison
9. Most frequent merchant category per account
10. Transactions in the last 30 days
11. Branch with maximum transactions
12. Customers with both Savings and Current accounts
13. International transactions per customer
14. Suspicious multi-location activity detection
15. Total fraud cases per branch

## 🛠 SQL Concepts Used

* INNER JOIN / LEFT JOIN
* GROUP BY & HAVING
* Aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
* Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
* CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
* Date filtering & interval analysis
* CASE statements
* Fraud pattern identification logic

---

## 🗂 Database Schema

Tables used:

* `customers`
* `accounts`
* `transactions`
* `branches`
* `fraud_flags`

Each table is connected using primary and foreign keys to maintain relational integrity.
